<h1>Happy Father's Day</h1>
<h2>Hey Daddy,</h2>
<p>i would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you have done to me. You have overlooked<br>all the mistakes i have made in the past and always tried to bring the best out of me. You have given me guidance,<br>support that nobody else could have ever given.You helped me at every step possible<br> and gave me excellent education,advice and freedom to do whatever i wanted.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am sorry for not being able to get the results you expected. I did try my best. You had extreme trust in me<br> and yet i failed. I promise that this is going to be my last major failure in life.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once again, I would like to thank you for cheering me on, and for giving me everything i know.</p>
<hr>
<p>With love and gratitude,<br>Ekansh</p>
<hr>
<p>A little gift</p>
